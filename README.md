# Mano

**Bringing dignity, safety, and structure to informal labor.**

Mano is a digital platform built for day laborers and gig workers. It helps workers and employers connect through safer, more structured systems rooted in community, trust, and accountability.

We partner with nonprofit organizations, workforce centers, and advocacy groups to ensure the platform reflects the needs of real people navigating informal work.

## What Mano Offers

- **Virtual check-in zones** ("digital parking lots") for worker visibility
- **Escrow-secured job postings** to help prevent wage theft
- **Instant job creation and sharing** via app, SMS, or WhatsApp
- **Optional verification** for workers and employers
- **Multilingual, mobile-first design** for accessibility
- **No cut from worker pay** — employers cover platform fees

*Mano is built by and for workers. We believe informal labor should be visible, respected, and safe — one job, one community, one block at a time.*
